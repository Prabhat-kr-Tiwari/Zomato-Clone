ViewModel:

ViewModel is responsible for holding and managing the UI-related data for an activity or fragment.
It survives configuration changes, such as screen rotations, by retaining the data during the lifecycle of the associated activity or fragment.
ViewModel allows the data to be decoupled from the UI components, promoting separation of concerns.
It provides a way to store and retrieve data, handle user interactions, and perform business logic related to the UI.

Repository:

Repository acts as a mediator between the data sources (e.g., remote server, local database) and the ViewModel.
It abstracts the data access details and provides a clean API for the ViewModel to fetch or save data.
Repository centralizes data handling logic, enabling different data sources to be used transparently without affecting the ViewModel.
It manages data caching, data synchronization, and other data-related operations.

ViewModelFactory:

ViewModelFactory is responsible for creating instances of the ViewModel with the required dependencies.
It provides a way to pass dependencies to the ViewModel at the time of creation.
ViewModelFactory is typically used when the ViewModel requires a parameterized constructor or when there are dependencies to be injected into the ViewModel.
It helps with the separation of concerns and allows better testing by providing a way to inject mocks or stubs into the ViewModel during testing.

The overall flow is as follows:

The Activity or Fragment requests a ViewModel instance using the ViewModelProvider, which takes a ViewModelFactory as a parameter.
The ViewModelProvider uses the ViewModelFactory to create an instance of the ViewModel, passing the required dependencies.
The ViewModel, being lifecycle-aware, is associated with the lifecycle of the Activity or Fragment.
The ViewModel interacts with the Repository to fetch or save data, perform business logic, and manage the UI-related state.
The UI components observe the data changes in the ViewModel using LiveData or other observable mechanisms and update the UI accordingly.
Using ViewModel, Repository, and ViewModelFactory together promotes separation of concerns, improves testability, and provides a clean and maintainable architecture for Android applications.
